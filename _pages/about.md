Hello! I'm Abiodun, a Lecturer and Coordinator of the Big Data Science program at the University of Pretoria's Computer Science Department. I am affiliated with the Data Science for Social Impact [(DSFSI)](https://www.dsfsi.co.za/) research lab and serve as a Faculty Fellow at African Data Science & Artificial Intelligence [AfriDSAI](https://www.up.ac.za/afridsai), where I led research at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and computational social science. I also hold a Global Perspectives Responsible AI Fellowship position at the [Stimson Center](https://www.stimson.org/project/responsible-ai-fellowship/fellows/) funded by Microsoft, contributing to the AI & Environment working group. My work focused on AI (NLP), particularly to address linguistic and cultural disparities in AI systems for low-resource languages, computational digital and cybersecurity.

From 2009 to 2018, I served as a Lecturer at Tshwane University of Technology [TUT](https://tut.ac.za/), teaching database systems, networking, and object-oriented programming while supervising both undergraduate and postgraduate students. My research has attracted competitive funding from the [AI4D African Languages Lab](https://www.ai4d.ai/projects/ai4d-african-languages-lab) over $1 million CAD, Google exploreCSR Program [CSR](https://research.google/programs-and-events/past-programs/explorecsr/?filtertab=2023) ($18,000 USD), and the [AfriGemma](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FuXxogbWdQ2ZZrs0YXJwlBQNSCF4QPJ9/view) initiative for Advancing African Language NLP ($200,000 USD). During my PhD at University of the Witwatersrand [WITS)(https://tinyurl.com/5fmvrcfj), Johannesburg, I proposed a digital tool to analyze and interpret humanities data for generalizability and reliability of forensic analyses using social media data.
