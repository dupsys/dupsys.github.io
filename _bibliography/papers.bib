ABSTRACT = {Post-authorship attribution is a scientific process of using stylometric features to identify the genuine writer of an online text snippet such as an email, blog, forum post, or chat log. It has useful applications in manifold domains, for instance, in a verification process to proactively detect misogynistic, misandrist, xenophobic, and abusive posts on the internet or social networks. The process assumes that texts can be characterized by sequences of words that agglutinate the functional and content lyrics of a writer. However, defining an appropriate characterization of text to capture the unique writing style of an author is a complex endeavor in the discipline of computational linguistics. Moreover, posts are typically short texts with obfuscating vocabularies that might impact the accuracy of authorship attribution. The vocabularies include idioms, onomatopoeias, homophones, phonemes, synonyms, acronyms, anaphora, and polysemy. The method of the regularized deep neural network (RDNN) is introduced in this paper to circumvent the intrinsic challenges of post-authorship attribution. It is based on a convolutional neural network, bidirectional long short-term memory encoder, and distributed highway network. The neural network was used to extract lexical stylometric features that are fed into the bidirectional encoder to extract a syntactic feature-vector representation. The feature vector was then supplied as input to the distributed high networks for regularization to minimize the network-generalization error. The regularized feature vector was ultimately passed to the bidirectional decoder to learn the writing style of an author. The feature-classification layer consists of a fully connected network and a SoftMax function to make the prediction. The RDNN method was tested against thirteen state-of-the-art methods using four benchmark experimental datasets to validate its performance. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the method when compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods on three datasets while producing comparable results on one dataset.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to describe an energy function model base on Geographic Adaptive Fidelity (GAF), which is one of the best known topology management schemes used in saving energy consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks. In wireless ad-hoc network, the nodes responsible for the transmission of data are battery-operated and as a result, there is a need for energy to be conserved in order to prolong the battery lifespan. Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA) metaheuristics are compared to minimize the energy consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks modelled by rectangular GAF. Results show that GA and SA meta-heuristics are useful optimization techniques for minimizing the energy consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.}
